# PowerGit app with clean architecture

Applying Uncle Bobs' clean architecture + MVI pattern to build a powerful github client Android app - Powergit. 

This project also demonstrates how to use latest techniques (architecture components, RxJava, dagger 2 dependency injection) to fast-develop a robust application (testable, maintainable, extendable, easy to maintain, support offline mode and lanscape mode...)

## Any small contributions are welcome
This project is under developing and there are so many features still need to be implemented. Don't hesitate to create a pull request even it's a small bug fixing or implementing a whole feature, or at least an issue report.

First you need to understand the architecture principle. If you haven't read or don't have time to read [Uncle Bob's book][book], I recommend reading [these articles][domain-centric] to know what is "domain centric" system which is the begining idea of clean architecture.
